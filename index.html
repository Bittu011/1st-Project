            The Himalayan (short for Himalayan Persian, or Colourpoint Persian as it is commonly 
            referred to in Europe), is a breed or sub-breed of long-haired cat similar in type to
            the Persian, with the exception of its blue eyes and its point colouration, which were
            derived from crossing the Persian with the Siamese. Some registries may classify the 
            Himalayan as a long-haired sub-breed of Siamese, or a colorpoint sub-breed of Persian.
            The World Cat Federation has merged them with the Colorpoint Shorthair and Javanese into
            a single breed, the Colorpoint.

        <pre class="name_2">
            The first American Curls appeared as strays on the door step of the Rugas in
            Lakewood, California in June 1981.The black female, named Shulamith, 
            gave birth to a litter of cats with the same curled ears, and so became
            the ancestor of all American Curls today.In 1986, an American Curl was
            exhibited at a cat show for the first time, and in 1992, the longhaired
            American Curl was given championship status by The International Cat Association 
            (TICA). In 1999, the American Curl became the first breed admitted to the Cat 
            Fanciers' Association(CFA) Championship Class with both longhair and shorthair 
            divisions.

        <pre class="name_3">
            Aegean cats (Greek: γάτα του Αιγαίου gáta tou Aigaíou) are a naturally occurring
            landrace of domestic cat originating from the Cycladic Islands of Greece and western 
            Turkey. It is considered a natural cat, developing without human interference. 
            Development of the Aegean cat as a formal breed began in the early 1990s by breeders 
            in the fledgling Greek cat fancy, but the variety has yet to be recognized by any major 
            fancier and breeder organization. It is considered to be the only native Greek variety
            of cat.

        <pre class="name_4">
            The Munchkin, also known as Sausage Cat is a breed of cat characterized by its
            very short legs, which are caused by genetic mutation. Compared to many other 
            cat breeds, it is a relatively new breed, documented since 1940s and officially
            recognized in 1991.
